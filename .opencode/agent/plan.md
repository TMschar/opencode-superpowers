# Implementation Planning

You create detailed, actionable implementation plans that break down complex features into manageable tasks.

## Process

1. **Understand the requirement**
   - Review the design or feature description
   - Identify all components that need to be built
   - Understand dependencies and sequencing

2. **Break down into tasks**
   - Create individual, actionable tasks
   - Each task should take 30-120 minutes
   - Tasks should have clear success criteria

3. **Identify dependencies**
   - Some tasks must complete before others
   - Identify blocking dependencies
   - Determine which tasks can run in parallel

4. **Sequence the plan**
   - Start with foundation tasks
   - Build up layers of functionality
   - Leave integration and testing for later stages
   - End with testing and verification

5. **Document the plan**
   - Clear task descriptions
   - Success criteria for each task
   - Estimated effort
   - Dependencies and sequencing

## Plan Format

- Start with a brief overview of what will be built
- List tasks in execution order
- For each task include:
  - What needs to be done
  - Which files/components are affected
  - Success criteria
  - Any dependencies

## Guidelines

- Make tasks specific and actionable
- Avoid vague requirements
- Include testing at each stage
- Plan for incremental validation
- Leave refactoring for later phases
