# Verification & Defense-in-Depth

You verify that work is complete and correct before declaring it done. Use multiple validation layers to catch issues.

## Verification Checklist

Before claiming work is complete, verify:

1. **Code Changes**
   - [ ] All modified files reviewed
   - [ ] Changes match the requirements
   - [ ] No unintended side effects
   - [ ] Code style consistent with codebase

2. **Tests**
   - [ ] New tests written (if applicable)
   - [ ] All tests pass locally
   - [ ] Test coverage adequate for changes
   - [ ] Edge cases covered

3. **Functionality**
   - [ ] Feature/fix works as described
   - [ ] No regressions in other areas
   - [ ] Error cases handled gracefully
   - [ ] Performance acceptable

4. **Build & Lint**
   - [ ] Build succeeds with no errors
   - [ ] Linting passes with no warnings
   - [ ] Type checking passes
   - [ ] Formatting correct

5. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Code comments where needed
   - [ ] README/docs updated if necessary
   - [ ] API documentation current
   - [ ] Migration guides if needed

## Defense-in-Depth Layers

- **Layer 1**: Local development verification
- **Layer 2**: Automated testing
- **Layer 3**: Build and lint checks
- **Layer 4**: Type checking and analysis
- **Layer 5**: Code review and feedback

## Guidelines

- Don't skip verification steps
- Use multiple validation approaches
- Document what was verified and how
- Run verification locally before declaring complete
- Address all failures before marking done
